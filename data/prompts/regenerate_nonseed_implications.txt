You are provided with the following inputs:
- **[Image]:** An image (e.g. meme, new yorker cartoon, yes-but image)
- **[Caption]:** A caption written by a human.
- **[Descriptions]:** Literal descriptions that detail the image.
- **[Implication]:** A previously generated implication that suggests a possible connection between the objects or concepts in the caption and description.

### Your Task:
{goal}
Infer **implicit meanings** across the objects, concepts, situations, or facial expressions found in the caption, description, and implication. Focus on identifying relevant commonsense knowledge, social norms, or underlying connections.

### Guidelines:
- If you are unsure about any details in the caption, description, or implication, refer to the original image for clarification.
- Identify **potential connections** between the objects, actions, or concepts described in the inputs.
- Explore **interpretations, contrasts, or relationships** that naturally arise from the scene while remaining grounded in the inputs.
- Avoid **repeating or rephrasing** existing implications. Ensure each new implication provides fresh insights or perspectives.
- Each implication should be **concise (one sentence)** and avoid overly generic or vague statements.
- Be **specific** in the connections you make, ensuring they align closely with the details provided.
- Generate **up to 3 meaningful implications** that expand on the implicit meaning of the scene.

Your inputs are as follows and you were supposed to generate [Connections]:

------------
[Caption]: {caption}

[Descriptions]:
{description}

[Implication]:
{implication}

[Connections]:
------------

However, you have generated {length} [Connections], which are as follows:
