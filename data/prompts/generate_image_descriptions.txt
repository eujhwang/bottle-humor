Describe the image by focusing on the noun phrases that highlight the actions, expressions, and interactions of the main visible objects, facial expressions, and people.

Here are some guidelines when generating image descriptions:
* Provide specific and detailed references to the objects, their actions, and expressions. Avoid using pronouns in the description.
* Do not include trivial details such as artist signatures, autographs, copyright marks, or any unrelated background information.
* Focus only on elements that directly contribute to the meaning, context, or main action of the scene.
* If you are unsure about any object, action, or expression, do not make guesses or generate made-up elements.
* Write each sentence on a new line.
* Limit the description to a maximum of 5 sentences, with each focusing on a distinct and relevant aspect that directly contribute to the meaning, context, or main action of the scene.
